# ProductivityYoutube
Chrome extension that removes some distracting features of YouTube including the sidebar and comment section. And yes... I did make this when I was supposed to be watching a lecture on YouTube!

> Select "load unpacked" and upload productivity-youtube folder as an extension.
> You're done! Toggle on the extension when you want a distraction-free Youtube experience.
